We are pleased to introduce our project, which involves building and programming a robot capable of traversing a specific path. This path consists of a white carpet with two lines in each corner, as well as an orange line and a blue line. The carpet measures three meters long and three meters wide, surrounded by a 10-cm-high black wooden wall, with a 10-cm-high square black wooden wall in the middle of the carpet.

## Power and Sense Management  
We used a **12.6-volt, 6A rechargeable lithium battery**. It’s medium weight with large capacity, sufficient for all components. Power was carefully distributed to prevent any single part from overloading.

## Obstacle Management  
The robot deals with obstacles using **ultrasonic sensors** and a **camera**.  

- **Ultrasonic technology** measures distance by sending sound waves and measuring their bounce.  
- **The camera** recognizes colors and sends a signal to the Raspberry Pi.

## Engineering Factor  
We started with a ready-made kit and modified it to suit our task. We added extra layers to contain all the parts and ensured balanced weight distribution, placing the battery in the middle to prevent tilting.

## Hardware  

### 1- The Robot  
We modified a ready-made kit by adding one acrylic layer and two plastic layers, giving us four in total:  
- Ground layer: DC motor and servo motor  
- Second layer: Battery  
- Third layer: Power button and power regulation circuit  
- Fourth layer: Raspberry Pi, gyroscope, three ultrasonic sensors, camera and motor driver

## Experience and Acquired Expertise  
We gained valuable skills, including:  
- Team spirit, cooperation, and shared decision-making  
- Problem-solving in programming and hardware  
- Overcoming obstacles in our first robotics project  

We also developed advanced technical expertise, such as:  
- Developing intelligent systems based on computer vision and integrating multiple sensors to increase robot awareness of the surrounding environment  
- Developing an integrated vehicle based on open-source components, including motors, sensors, and electromechanical control systems
