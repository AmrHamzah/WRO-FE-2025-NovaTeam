<h1 style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:40px;">Hi, we are Nova team Participant in WRO future engineers 2025</h1>

<h1 style="font-family:Verdana;">About us</h1>

<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We are a team of three members :

<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We are pleased to introduce you to our project, which is to build and program a robot capable of traversing a specific path, which is a path consisting of a white carpet and two lines in each corner, an orange line and a blue line. The dimensions of the carpet are three meters long and a three meter wide area surrounded by a 10-cm-high black wooden wall and a 10-cm-high square black wooden wall in the middle of the carpet.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Verdana;">Hardware:</h1>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">1- The robot in general</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used a ready made kit and modified it to suit our task by adding a layer of acrylic and two layers of plastic to give us additional space for assembling parts. The total number of layers became four the ground layer is the DC motor and servo motor The second layer is the battery The third layer is for the power button and the power regulation circuit The third layer is for the Raspberry Pi, the gyroscope, the three ultrasonic sensors, the camera, and the driver we connected it by jumper wires
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">2- Kit used</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
The MG996 is a car model with a servo motor and a DC motor We used this kit because it's available in Palestine and suitable for our task With some modifications, it costs $95 on AliExpress

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">3- The microcontroller used</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8 GB RAM because it's available in Palestine, has a fast CPU, and uses Python, which we have some background in. Its price on AliExpress is $92

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">4- Battery</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used a 12.6 volt, 6 A lithium battery We used this battery because it provides a high voltage that we can adjust to suit any part used in the robot, and its high capacity saves us from having to replace the battery
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">5- DC Power Converter</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used the XL4015 because it's easy to install and can control voltages from 32V to 1.25V. It costs $1 on AliExpress.

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">6- Ultrasonic</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used three HC-SR04 ultrasonic probes because they are inexpensive, use a low voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, are highly accurate, provide an excellent range of 2 cm to 400 cm, and are widely available. The price of one unit is $1 on AliExpress

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">7- Motor Driver</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used an L298N motor driver because it's sufficient for the number of motors used, provides adequate voltage for the motors we're using, and is widely available. It costs $1.50 on AliExpress

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">8_ Gyroscope</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used the MPU-6050 gyroscope because it combines two sensors: a gyroscope and an accelerometer. It's small and available. It costs $2 on AliExpress

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">9- Camera</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used an ultra wide USB camera because it's better than a regular Raspberry Pi camera and easier to program.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">10- Jumper Wires</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used reusable male-to-male, male-to-female, and female-to-female jumper wires. They're strong, deliver the voltage we need, and are compatible with Raspberry Pi pins. All three kinds costs $3 in AliExpress

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">11- On/Off Button</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used a regular on/off button, which is widely available, inexpensive, and easy to install and use.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Verdana;">Software:</h1>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">1- Language Used</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used Python 3 because it's the Raspberry Pi programming language. We have a background in it, and it offers many libraries for all pieces. It also has a large community of programmers.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">2- Raspberry Pi Operating System</h2>
<p style="font-family:Verdana;">
We used a Linux system compatible with the Raspberry Pi version we had, which included some of the main libraries and some programming programs.
</p>
